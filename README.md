# New York Stock Exchange Project
### Project from Udacity using excel, featuring financial forecasting and statistics. 

The two files are the **excel** file with the profit and loss statement and a deeper look into one specific company, as well as a **powerpoint** slide identifing a pattern in the data. 

In the first tab of the excel file, you can see a profit and loss table which allows the user to choose any company by its ticker symbol and year and gets the resulting NYSE information as well as some calculated cells. 

In the second tab, you can see a forecast projection for one specific company in the real estate sector, which gives the user the ability to change the scenario for forecasting from strong, base, and weak case assumptions.

In the third tab, you can see summary statistics for the real estate and energy sectors across the data and the resulting pattern. 

I delved deeper into this pattern in the subsequent powerpoint slide, in which I argue for the risk of investing in either of the two sectors pinpointed.
